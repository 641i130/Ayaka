# Internationalization
## ICU
The i18n feature are supported by [ICU4X](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x) with [CLDR](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr) data.
We use CLDR to choose the best fit locale for current system.

## Simplify translation
The translation of the texts is always a difficult job. You don't need to copy all commands as is.
For example, the original text (`ja`)
``` ignore
- bg: 0
- /rd//団長！車の用意できました！
- switches:
  - おう！
  - 止まるんじゃねぇぞ！
  - 止まれ！
```
could be translated as (`zh-Hans`)
``` ignore
-
- 团长！车已经准备好了！
- switches:
  - 哦！
  - 不要停下来啊！
  - 停下！
```

## Fallback
The resources, commands, and even paragraphs could be fell back, if a translated one is not apparent.
However, some other ones couldn't be fell back.

### Fallback with empty text
If a certain translated line is empty, it will fall back to the base language one.
