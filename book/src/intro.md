# Introduction
Ayaka project was initially a project for OSPP 2022.
It is a voice novel engine which aims at 3 goals: simple, free, concentrate.

## Simple
A visual novel should be easy to author.
The author need little knowledge of programming.
We provide a config file format based on YAML and TeX-like commands.
It is easy to learn and author your own voice novel.

## Free
You are free to implement anything you'd like with our plugin system.
We provide a simple, but also strong script plugin by default.
The plugin system provides possibility to calculate and hook important parts in the runtime.

## Concentrate
The project is separated into 4 parts: runtime, plugins, config, frontend.
You can concentrate at one part without knowing about others.
If you like, you can write config file only, and author a voice novel.
You can also write your own fantastic game by customizing the frontend.
